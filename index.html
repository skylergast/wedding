									I love: I'll start with the obvious...Skyler, my family, smiling just to smile, my AMAZING friends, 
									rainy days except when I'm working, using my job to share Christ's love, being silly, 
									reading a good book, my grandma's apple pie, bright colors, homey spaces, killing people 
									with kindness when they insist on being rude, jeans from ebay, finding a bargin and most 
									of all, maybe even more than Skyler, my AMAZING Savior who is always with me and alive 
									inside me.

						We met at Mercy Place at Lifegroup in September, 2009.  Over the next few months we got to know each other 
						through Lifegroup events, MP functions [<span class='skyler' title='Skyler'>She dominated in Turkey Bowl</span>] 
						and other group things, two significant ones being Hailee's Ugly Sweater Christmas party and New Years Eve.<br /><br />
						We started dating in January of 2010 [<span class='staci' title='Staci'>the exact date was January 23</span>] 
						[<span class='skyler' title='Skyler'>I know.. I know.. Why did it take me so long?!</span>].  
						January to August was full of great times: we started to co-lead our Lifegroup, took a few 
						weekend trips together to see friends and family, <span class='skyler' title='Skyler'>took Staci to the driving range</span>, 
						<span class='staci' title='Staci'>beat Skyler in almost every game we played</span> and many 
						other fun and memorable things.<br /><br />We got engaged August 21st and have been growing 
						closer and getting to know each other more every day.  
						We know that God has brought us together and has great plans for our marriage!

						Skyler knew that my family and friends mean a lot to me so he asked me to marry 
						him in front of all my family and friends.it was perfect. <br /><br />I went Italy with my mom 
						the week before and before I left I told Skyler "don't forget my dad is in Dallas on 
						Tuesday if you need to ask him anything". [<span class='skyler' title='Skyler'>I was already planning to ask.</span>] Later found out that he did have dinner with my 
						dad and asked him. He was so nervous that he had everything he wanted to say written out.<br /><br />
						When we got back from our trip, Skyler was adamant about going to my house for just a 
						Friday night. [<span class='skyler' title='Skyler'>I tried to make it seem like her idea; I guess it didn't work...</span>] He said that I would probably want to show off pictures from my trip. 
						So I didn't turn down an offer go to home even if it was for just one night. <br /><br />
						On Saturday, we went to Saturday morning breakfast with my Memaw and Aunt Jimi Lou 
						which has been a tradition in our family for years. I later learned that my Aunt Janet 
						was there and had to leave with the kids before Skyler and I got there. So after breakfast 
						Memaw asked us to come over for lunch which isn't an unusual thing because we have lunch at 
						Memaw's quite often. After we had breakfast, Skyler tried to keep me occupied until noon so we 
						went shopping, to sonic and then a park by my house. Then we went to lunch at my memaw's and we 
						pull up to the house and there were tons of cars there and I asked him what was going on and he 
						grabbed my hand said "just come on". So I followed and then when we got around the corner and 
						saw everyone then Skyler got down on one knee and asked me to marry him and of course I said 
						YES!!!!!! <br /><br />I can't even remember if he asked or if I just said yes. He also said "Staci, I love 
						you and want to spend the rest of my life with you". This was a really big deal because we had 
						never said those words to each other.  It was such a wonderful time and I was so happy that we 
						all my friends and family were there to celebrate with us. [<span class='skyler' title='Skyler'>Thanks for keeping it a secret for 2 weeks!</span>] I could not imagine a more perfect 
						proposal. Oh and to make it even more special later on that day Skyler gave me a journal that 
						detailed the ring shopping, asking my dad and all the planning that went into the big day. He 
						also added a couple of pages of sweet letters to me.<br /><br />I'm so thankful to God who brought us 
						together and who we know will keep us together as one forever. 
						I can't wait to marry Skyler!!! <span class='skyler' title='Skyler'>I can't wait to marry Staci!!!</span>
